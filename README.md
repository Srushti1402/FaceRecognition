# FaceRecognition
for face recognition we need to create the training data folder and the subfolders as s0,s1.... so on and in s0 folder we need to add images of any one person...
for example..
in s0 folder images of shahrukh khan
s1 folder images of mindy
etc


and in test data folder provide random images to check if algo is detecting and recognizing the face.
